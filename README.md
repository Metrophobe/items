# Item Boilerplate 

This is a boilerplate app that i created to show how you can use, NodeJS / Express / EJS and an MVC pattern to create a CRUD application. Have been asked many times how you could implement this from scratch and here it is. I did not delve into a fully fledged app but It does explain how CRUD is done and also how routing is handled apart from the templates used in Views (via EJS). This example makes use of an in-memory collection but you can easily modify it to 
make use of a db..... Enjoy!

## Installation
Download and install the missing modules.  Make sure you have node and npm installed. 

## Installing Missing Modules
